# Documentation Guidelines

All documentation files are stored in this directory.

- Keep `README.md` updated whenever new guides are added or existing ones are renamed.
- Ensure links to documents remain valid and use relative paths.
- When benchmark numbers change, update `performance.md` with the new results.
