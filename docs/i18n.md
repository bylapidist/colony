# Localization Guide

Colony uses a lightweight translation system backed by Java's `ResourceBundle`.
All user-facing text is stored in property files and retrieved at runtime through
`I18n`.

## I18n Utility

The class `net.lapidist.colony.util.I18n` exposes two simple methods:

- `I18n.get("key")` – return the translated string for `key`. Missing keys are
  returned as `!key!` so they are easy to spot during development.
- `I18n.setLocale(Locale locale)` – change the active language. The current
  locale can be read with `I18n.getLocale()`.

`SettingsScreen` provides buttons that call `I18n.setLocale` and store the
selection in the user's settings so the chosen language is loaded on the next
startup.

## Translation Files

Translation bundles live under `core/src/main/resources/i18n`. `messages.properties`
contains the default English strings. Additional locales use the filename
`messages_<code>.properties` where `<code>` is an ISO 639 language code. For
example:

- `messages_es.properties` – Spanish
- `messages_fr.properties` – French
- `messages_de.properties` – German

Each file defines the same keys, for example:

```properties
main.continue=Continue
main.newGame=New Game
```

## Adding a New Locale

1. Create a `messages_<code>.properties` file next to the existing bundles.
2. Copy all keys from `messages.properties` and translate each value.
3. Rebuild the project so the resource bundle is updated.
4. Call `I18n.setLocale(new Locale("<code>"))` from the client to use the new
   translations. You can extend `SettingsScreen` with another button to let
   players switch to the new language.

## Switching Languages In-Game

Open the Settings screen from the main menu. Choosing a language button invokes
`I18n.setLocale` and saves the choice to the user's settings. The selected
locale is applied immediately and restored on the next launch.
